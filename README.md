This project is a Library Management System developed in C++ using linked lists to manage books and student data. It supports key operations such as issuing books to students, returning books, and maintaining a catalog of available books. The program allows users to add books to the library, issue them based on book ID, and track student details such as name, email, and borrowed books. The system dynamically updates the library inventory by removing issued books and re-adding returned ones, ensuring accurate record-keeping and easy access to student borrowing history.
