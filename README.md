This C++ program simulates a student library management system, allowing users to issue and return books, and maintain records of students and their issued books. The program utilizes linked lists to manage data structures for books and students, providing an efficient way to track availability and student interactions with the library. Key features include:

Book Issuance: Students can view available books and issue them by providing their details.\n
Book Return: Students can return books, with the system updating the available books in the library.\n
Student Records: The program keeps track of students who have borrowed books, displaying their details upon request.\n
Dynamic Memory Management: Utilizes pointers and dynamic memory allocation to manage book and student records.\n
This project is an excellent example of implementing data structures and object-oriented programming concepts in C++.\n
